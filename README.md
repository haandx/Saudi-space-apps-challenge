# Saudi-space-apps-challenge: OCEAN APP
## The story behind the app:
One day, while we were walking on the seashore,  we wanted to catch some fishes. one of my brothers caught a strange, beautiful-colored fish that we had never seen before. 
First, we wondered about its type and its edibility. We took a picture of it, and my brother went to the nearby fish stores to ask them about its type. The answers varied between them, but it came back to no avail. So we cooked it and ate it.
After a lot of research, we discovered that it is a rare and endangered type of fish called Broomtail wrasse (Cheilinus lunulatus) .

## what is ocean app for ?
1. specializes in marine life and informs people about endangered species based on the area they want to know.
2. helps swimmers know the places designated for swimming.
3. fishing enthusiasts can know the places where they can fish without affecting endangered species. NASA sources will be used to determine these places.
4. connect local users to the regions and enable them to express their opinions and give them general guideline and information related to the region.

## In the future, we plan to introduce a diving experience through virtual reality, in addition to a camera that helps determine the type of fish and the possibility that it is threatened with extinction.
